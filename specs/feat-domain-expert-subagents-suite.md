# Feature Specification: Domain Expert Subagents Suite

**Title**: Complete Domain Expert Subagents Implementation  
**Status**: Draft  
**Authors**: Claude Code Assistant  
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Related Specs**: feat-domain-expert-subagents.md

## Overview

This specification defines the implementation of a comprehensive suite of domain expert subagents for claudekit, following the hierarchical domain expert model. The suite will provide broad domain coverage with selective sub-domain specialization, enabling efficient problem-solving through task-specific AI assistants with concentrated knowledge and environmental adaptation capabilities.

## Background/Problem Statement

While the infrastructure for subagents is complete and a TypeScript expert exists as MVP, users need a broader range of domain experts to handle common development tasks effectively. The current single-agent approach limits the system's ability to provide specialized expertise across different domains while maintaining manageable context windows and focused problem-solving capabilities.

Key challenges:
- Developers work across multiple domains requiring different expertise
- General AI assistants lack concentrated domain knowledge
- Context pollution reduces effectiveness in long sessions
- No systematic approach to organizing specialized knowledge

## Goals

- Implement 8 core broad domain experts covering essential development areas
- Create 15 high-priority sub-domain experts for deep specialization
- Establish a repeatable playbook for creating consistent, high-quality agents
- Provide hierarchical organization for efficient agent selection
- Enable project-specific customization while maintaining shareable base agents
- Ensure all agents follow established patterns and pass quality checks

## Non-Goals

- Creating task-specific agents (e.g., "fix-circular-deps-agent")
- Implementing all 25+ extended coverage agents in initial release
- Building agent discovery or marketplace features
- Modifying Claude Code's core subagent mechanism
- Creating agents for non-development domains

## Technical Dependencies

### External Libraries/Frameworks
- Claude Code v0.7.1+ (native subagent support)
- Node.js 18+ (for setup tooling)
- Git (for version control integration)
- Language-specific tools per domain (detected at runtime)

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing claudekit infrastructure (setup command, component registry)
- Agent validation framework (tests/unit/test-subagents.sh)
- Create-subagent command for templating

### Documentation Sources
Each agent will reference official documentation:
- React: React 18/19 docs, Next.js docs
- Node.js: Node.js API docs, diagnostics guides
- Testing: Jest/Vitest/Playwright documentation
- Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB vendor docs
- DevOps: Docker/GitHub Actions documentation

   - Write one-sentence scope statement
   - List 5-15 recurring problems (frequency × complexity)
   - Map sub-domain expert recommendations

2. **Build Topic Map**
   - Identify 3-6 problem categories
   - For each category, collect:
     - Top error messages and symptoms
     - Root causes
     - Prioritized fixes (1→2→3)
     - Diagnostic commands
     - Validation steps
     - 2-5 official documentation links

3. **Apply Canonical Template**
   - Use typescript-expert as reference
   - Include frontmatter with proactive trigger
   - Add Step 0 recommend-and-stop logic
   - Implement environment detection
   - Add problem playbooks
   - Include runtime caveats

4. **Source Official Documentation**
   - Prioritize official docs over third-party
   - Distill patterns, don't dump content
   - Focus on non-obvious knowledge
   - Include runnable diagnostics

5. **Validate Safety and Quality**
   - Ensure one-shot diagnostics only
   - Guard optional tools
   - Prefer project scripts
   - Test with validation framework

### Code Structure and File Organization

```typescript
// cli/lib/agents/registry.ts
export const AGENT_PHASES = {
  phase1: {
    core: [
      'react-expert',
      'nodejs-expert', 
      'testing-expert',
      'database-expert',
      'git-expert',
      'code-quality-expert',
      'devops-expert'
    ]
  },
  phase2: {
    typescript: ['type-expert', 'build-expert'],
    react: ['performance-expert'],
    frontend: ['css-styling-expert', 'accessibility-expert'],
    testing: ['jest-expert', 'vitest-expert', 'playwright-expert'],
    database: ['postgres-expert', 'mongodb-expert'],
    infrastructure: ['docker-expert', 'github-actions-expert'],
    buildTools: ['webpack-expert', 'vite-expert', 'nextjs-expert']
  }
};
```

### API Changes

No API changes required. Agents integrate with existing infrastructure:
- Setup command discovers agents automatically
- `/create-subagent` command for new agents
- Component registry handles installation

### Data Model Changes

No data model changes. Agents use established format:
- YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools
- Markdown body with system prompt
- Standard file locations (.claude/agents/)

### Integration with External Libraries

Each agent will integrate with domain-specific tools:

**React Expert:**
- React DevTools detection
- JSX runtime analysis
- Next.js/Gatsby/CRA detection

**Testing Experts:**
- Jest/Vitest config detection
- Coverage tool integration
- Test runner discovery

**Database Experts:**
- Connection string parsing
- Migration tool detection
- ORM/ODM identification

## User Experience

### Discovery and Selection
Users interact with agents through:

1. **Automatic Delegation**: Claude proactively selects based on task
2. **Explicit Invocation**: "Use the react-expert to review components"
3. **Setup Wizard**: Choose agents during `claudekit setup`
4. **Hierarchical Fallback**: Sub-domain → Broad → General Claude

### Installation Options

```bash
# Interactive setup (choose agents)
claudekit setup

# Install all agents
claudekit setup --all

# Install specific phase
claudekit setup --agents phase1

# Skip agents
claudekit setup --skip-agents
```

### Usage Examples

```
# Automatic selection
> Fix the TypeScript type errors in my component
[typescript-type-expert automatically invoked]

# Explicit invocation  
> Use the react-performance-expert to optimize rendering
[react-performance-expert invoked]

# Hierarchical fallback
> How should I structure my tests?
[testing-expert invoked - no specific framework mentioned]

> How do I mock ES6 modules in Jest?
[test-jest-expert invoked - framework-specific]
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Each agent must pass validation:

```bash
# tests/unit/test-subagents.sh
test_agent_structure() {
  - Valid YAML frontmatter
  - Required fields (name, description)
  - Comprehensive prompt (50+ lines)
  - Problem playbooks present
  - Documentation links included
}

test_agent_safety() {
  - No watch/serve commands
  - Diagnostic commands only
  - Optional tools guarded
  - Project scripts preferred
}
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# tests/integration/test-agent-selection.sh
test_hierarchical_selection() {
  - Sub-domain expert selected for specific problems
  - Broad expert selected for general questions
  - Proper fallback chain
}

test_agent_installation() {
  - Agents copied correctly
  - Permissions preserved
  - Content integrity maintained
}
```

### E2E Tests

Manual testing with Claude Code:
1. Install agents via setup
2. Test automatic delegation
3. Verify explicit invocation
4. Check hierarchical fallback
5. Validate problem-solving effectiveness

### Test Documentation

Each test includes purpose comments:

```bash
# Purpose: Verify agents recommend sub-domain experts appropriately
# This ensures hierarchical organization works and prevents broad experts
# from attempting specialized tasks they're not equipped for
test_recommend_and_stop() {
  # Test implementation
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Agent Selection Performance
- Hierarchical organization reduces selection complexity
- Clear description fields enable fast matching
- Limited to 20-25 total agents keeps selection manageable

### Context Efficiency
- Each agent uses separate context window
- Concentrated knowledge reduces token usage
- Environmental adaptation minimizes exploration

### Startup Latency
- Agents start with clean slate (expected behavior)
- Environment detection adds 2-3 commands overhead
- Cached detection patterns for common setups

## Security Considerations

### Tool Restrictions
- Each agent specifies allowed tools explicitly
- No unrestricted bash access
- Read-only operations for analysis

### Code Safety
- No execution of untrusted code
- Validation before modifications
- Prefer non-destructive operations

### Information Disclosure
- No logging of sensitive data
- No exposure of API keys or secrets
- Project-specific knowledge stays local
