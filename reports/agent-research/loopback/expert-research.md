## 2. Topic Map (6 Categories)

### Category 1: Dependency Injection & Architecture

**Common Errors:**
- "The argument is not decorated for dependency injection but no value was supplied"
- "Cannot resolve injected arguments for [Provider]"
- "The key 'services.hasher' is not bound to any value"
- "Cannot read property 'findOne' of undefined"

**Root Causes:**
- Missing `@inject` decorators on constructor parameters
- Circular dependencies in service design
- Improper binding configuration in application setup
- Incorrect context binding in repository methods

**Fix Strategies:**
1. **Minimal**: Add missing `@inject` decorators to constructor parameters
2. **Better**: Redesign services to eliminate circular dependencies using facade patterns
3. **Complete**: Implement proper IoC container architecture with lifecycle management

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Enable dependency injection debugging
DEBUG=loopback:context:* npm start

# Check binding configuration
console.log(app.find('services.*'));
```

**Validation:**
- All services resolve without circular dependency errors
- Repository injection works in controllers
- Context binding provides expected instances

**Resources:**
- [Dependency Injection Guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Dependency-injection.html)
- [IoC Container Documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Context.html)

### Category 2: Database Integration & Repository Patterns

**Common Errors:**
- "Timeout in connecting after 5000 ms" (PostgreSQL)
- "Failed to connect to server on first connect - No retry" (MongoDB)
- "Transaction rollback not working properly"
- "Foreign key constraints not created during migration"

**Root Causes:**
- Database connector version incompatibilities
- Improper connection pool configuration
- Weak relationship enforcement by framework vs database
- Transaction implementation failures across connectors

**Fix Strategies:**
1. **Minimal**: Use `dataSource.ping()` instead of `dataSource.connect()` for PostgreSQL
2. **Better**: Configure proper connection pooling and retry logic
3. **Complete**: Implement robust transaction handling with proper rollback mechanisms

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Enable database connector debugging
DEBUG=loopback:connector:* npm start

# Test database connectivity
node -e "require('./dist').main().then(() => console.log('Connected'))"

# Check connection pool status
DEBUG=loopback:connector:postgresql npm start
```

**Validation:**
- Database connections establish successfully
- Transactions commit and rollback properly
- Foreign key constraints work as expected
- Connection pools don't exhaust under load

**Resources:**
- [Database Connectors](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Database-connectors.html)
- [Repository Pattern](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Repository.html)
- [Database Transactions](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Using-database-transactions.html)

### Category 3: Authentication & Security

**Common Errors:**
- CVE-2018-1778 Authentication bypass vulnerability
- SNYK-JS-LOOPBACK-174846 SQL injection in login endpoints
- JWT token validation failures
- CORS configuration exposing credentials

**Root Causes:**
- Exposed AccessToken REST endpoints
- Weak JWT configuration with long expiration
- Input validation bypasses in authentication
- Improper CORS origin reflection

**Fix Strategies:**
1. **Minimal**: Upgrade to LoopBack 3.26.0+ or disable AccessToken endpoints
2. **Better**: Implement proper JWT configuration with short expiration and algorithm validation
3. **Complete**: Comprehensive security framework with RBAC, input validation, and security headers

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Test authentication endpoints
curl -X POST /api/AccessTokens -d '{"userId": "admin"}'

# Validate JWT configuration
node -e "console.log(jwt.verify(token, secret, options))"

# Security audit
npm audit --audit-level moderate
```

**Validation:**
- No authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- JWT tokens expire properly and validate signatures
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- CORS policies restrict access appropriately

**Resources:**
- [Authentication Tutorial](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Authentication-tutorial.html)
- [RBAC Authorization](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/RBAC-with-authorization.html)
- [Security Considerations](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Security-considerations.html)

### Category 4: API Design & Testing

**Common Errors:**
- Controller routing limitations with multiple decorators
- Database connection leaks in tests
- Service mocking challenges in acceptance tests
- Hot reload configuration failures

**Root Causes:**
- Framework limitations on operation decorator count
- Improper test cleanup and datasource management
- Complex dependency injection in test environments
- Missing nodemon/TypeScript watch configuration

**Fix Strategies:**
1. **Minimal**: Use separate methods for different routes, add proper test cleanup
2. **Better**: Implement testing pyramid with unit/integration/acceptance layers
3. **Complete**: Full testing automation with hot reload and comprehensive mocking

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Test database connections in tests
DEBUG=loopback:* npm test

# Check for hanging tests
npm test -- --timeout 5000

# Validate hot reload setup
npm run start:watch
```

**Validation:**
- Tests pass without hanging or connection leaks
- Hot reload works for development workflow
- API endpoints return expected responses
- Mock services work properly in tests

- [Controller Documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Controller.html)
- [API Design Best Practices](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Defining-the-API-using-design-first-approach.html)

### Category 5: CLI Tools & Code Generation

**Common Errors:**
- `lb4 repository` fails with unclear error messages
- `lb4 relation` fails but still makes code changes
- CLI command failures with "You did not select a valid model"
- AST parsing errors with malformed configuration

**Root Causes:**
- Poor error handling in CLI commands
- Insufficient validation of input files
- AST helper function limitations
- Malformed JSON in datasource configuration

**Fix Strategies:**
1. **Minimal**: Validate JSON configuration files before running CLI commands
2. **Better**: Use explicit error handling and manual artifact creation when CLI fails
3. **Complete**: Custom generators and scaffolding for complex project requirements

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Validate configuration files
jq . src/datasources/*.json

# Check CLI version and dependencies
lb4 --version
npm ls @loopback/cli

# Debug CLI commands
DEBUG=loopback:cli:* lb4 repository
```

**Validation:**
- CLI commands complete successfully
- Generated code follows project conventions
- All configuration files are valid JSON

**Common Errors:**
- Docker containerization configuration issues
- Environment variable management problems
- CI/CD pipeline failures
- Performance bottlenecks in production

**Root Causes:**
- Missing Docker optimization strategies
- Improper secret management
- Inadequate monitoring and logging
- Memory usage and ORM performance issues

**Fix Strategies:**
1. **Minimal**: Use generated Dockerfile and basic environment configuration

3. **Complete**: Full DevOps pipeline with auto-scaling, monitoring, and performance optimization

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Test Docker build
docker build -t loopback-app .

# Check environment configuration
node -e "console.log(process.env)"

# Performance profiling
clinic doctor -- node .
```

**Validation:**
